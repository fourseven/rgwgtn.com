# Hello and welcome to our internet house. We are very happy to see you

This is hosted on Github Pages. That means that whatever is in the gh-pages branch goes up onto the internet. 

Feel free to make a **pull request** throughout the day. 

By default, you'll be in the **master** branch. To change branches, you go like: 

git checkout gh-pages

I have this page of the git documentation bookmarked: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
Seriously. So good. You'll love it
